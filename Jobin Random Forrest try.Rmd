## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
#bank_full.path <- file.choose()
#hello = read.csv(bank_full.path, header = TRUE, sep = ";")
bank_full <- read.csv("bank-additional-full.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ';')
summary(bank_full)
sapply(bank_full, class)


#Convert Columns to Numeric
#Move previous into other list 
num.cols <- c("age","duration","campaign","pdays","previous","emp.var.rate","cons.price.idx","cons.conf.idx","euribor3m","nr.employed")
bank_full[num.cols] <- lapply(bank_full[num.cols], as.numeric)
sapply(bank_full, class)

#Convert Columns to Factor
fac.col <- c("job","marital","education","default","housing","loan","contact","month","day_of_week", "poutcome","y")
bank_full[fac.col] <- lapply(bank_full[fac.col], as.factor)
sapply(bank_full, class)

set.seed(42)

RFmodel <- randomForest(y ~ age+ duration +campaign +pdays, data=bank_full, proximity=TRUE)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
